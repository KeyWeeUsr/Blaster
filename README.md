### Install

Blaster is written in Python and runs under Kivy framework.
You can clone the repository to your /sdcard/kivy/ if you use Kivy Launcher on
android. The game isn't complete yet, therefore no installers are available.
You'll need to run it via `python main.py` with Kivy installed on your
platform.

### About
Blaster is an arcade game inspired by an old Dyna Blaster game I played a long
ago. The environment is basically a grid with an unbreakable border, some
unbreakable columns in the middle and the rest is only you and monsters you
should defeat to, well... survive.

In each level there are two special blocks. One of them is an `Extra` block
which will increase some of your stats by a constant, the other one is a `Gate`
which you'll be able to use after all monsters in the level are dead. The gate
will then transfer you to a next level.

However, if you die, all your stats (especially the increased ones) will be
set back to their original values as a punishment for dying.

More levels, bosses and fancy stuff incoming.
